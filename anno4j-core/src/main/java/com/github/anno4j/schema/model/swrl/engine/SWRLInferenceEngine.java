/**
 * Inference engine for a subset of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Submission/SWRL/">Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL)</a>.<br/>
 * The engine infers new triples by subsequently checking the applicability of rules and applying the head of the rule.
 * The order of rule application within a round is determined by {@link #getConflictResolutionStrategy()}.<br/>
 * <b>Definitions:</b><br/>
 * <i>DL-bound variables</i> A variable is said to be DL-bound in a rule r if it occurs in at least one class
 * or role atom of the body of r. Otherwise it's free.<br/>
 * <i>Computable variable</i> A free variable x occurring in a built-in atom b is said to be computable by b if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Every other variable y in b is either DL-bound or is computable by another built-in b'.</li>
 *     <li>Computation for b is supported, i.e. there exists a corresponding class
 *     {@link com.github.anno4j.schema.model.swrl.builtin.SWRLBuiltin} that implements
 *     {@link com.github.anno4j.schema.model.swrl.builtin.Computation}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <i>Dependent built-in</i> A built-in b is dependent on b' if b has a computable variable that is computable by b'
 * and not by b. (i.e. in precedural means b' needs to "compute" first such that the result can be used in b).<br/>
 * <b>Supported subset of SWRL:</b>
 * A SWRL rule r := a â‡’ h is supported if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>r only uses OWL Lite constructs (classes/roles must be named)</li>
 *     <li>a contains at least one class or role atom</li>
 *     <li>Every built-in atom b in a has at most one variable that is computable by it</li>
 *     <li>a contains no free variables that are not computable</li>
 *     <li>The dependency relation of built-ins in a is cycle free</li>
 *     <li>h consists entirely of class and role atoms</li>
 *     <li>All variables of h are DL-bound or computable in a</li>
 * </ul>
